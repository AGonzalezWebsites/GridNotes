In addition to two brightness levels, the key advantage of this new magnifier lies in its wireless charging capability, which eliminates the need to replace batteries. Made with high-quality German optics by Schweizer, this aspheric, lightweight magnifying lens is scratch-resistant, and provides an accurate, sharply-defined image. The SMD LED light provides a bright, evenly dispersed and high contrast light. The ergonomic design places emphasis on comfort and ease of use by using a rubberized grip for the thumb and forefinger and a larger, rounded handle to support the ball of the hand. The easy-glide switch provides audible and tactile feedback and eliminates flickering.",
